# Real-Estate-Price-Regression

Machine learning project on Real Estate Price regression.This project is made on google colab using python language. 

The comparable sales approach is most common in residential real estate and uses recent sales of similar properties to determine the value of a subject property. The sales price of the “comps” are adjusted based on differences between them and the subject property.

The Machine learning techniques used are:-
Logistic Regression : Logistic Regression is easier to implement , interpret and very efficient to train. It is very fast at classifying unknown records. It is useful when variable to be predicted is categorical.


KNeighbors : KNeighbors Classifier implements classification based on voting by nearest K-Neighbors of target point. KNN classifies the new data points based on the similarity mesure of the earlier stored data points. 


Support Vector Machine : Support Vector Machine is used for classification and regression but it is well suited for classification . The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies th data points. The dimensions of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features.


Random Forest : Random Forest is a sophisticated and adaptive machine learning technique that create and combines a large number of decision tree to create a "forest". A number of decision trees are used on distinct subsets of the same dataset , and the average is used to improve the dataset's projected accuracy.
